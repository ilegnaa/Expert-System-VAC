# 1)What is an Expert System?
In computer science, a system or program which can learn about a particular field from the knowledge base and can simulate the behaviour and decisions of a human or an organization can be considered as the expert system.
# 2)The Three Câ€™s of the Expert System
# i)Characteristics
The system should be easy to use and understand for the users.
The results of the system should be highly reliable.
The system should be high performing and responsive
# ii)Capabilities 
The system should be capable of giving advice.
They should provide assistance to humans in making decisions.
They should be capable of diagnosing and resolving the problems.
 The results from the system should justify the conclusion of the system.
The system should have the capability of finding an alternative solution to a problem.
# iii)Components 
# Knowledge base: 
as we have discussed knowledge base is a container of the knowledge or information about the domain. Going on deeper side information in the knowledge base can be divided into two categories: facts and rules. Where facts are the information about the domain and the rules in the knowledge base can be considered as the way to solve the problems assigned to the domain.  
# Inference Engine: 
In the expert system the inference engine can be considered as the heart of the system. Because the main aim of the inference engine in an expert system is to circulate the queries from the user to the knowledge base and the solution of the queries from the knowledge base to the user. Mostly according to the queries it extracts relevant data from the knowledge base and makes the solution and circulates it further to the user. It can also be capable of debugging problems in the system. 
# Strategies used by the inference engine to provide or advise the solution can be divided into two main categories.
# Forward Chaining 
The below diagram is a representation of the forward chaining.

# Knowledge gainer: 
this component of the system helps the system to gain more knowledge about the domain from various sources and store the information in the knowledge base.
# User interface and explanation module: 
it is a combination of two components where the user interface helps the user to ask queries and the explanation module gives the solution to the user in an explanatory way so that the user can conclude in an easy manner.

# 3)Types of Expert Systems
On the basis of knowledge base and frame, and logic in the algorithm we can say there can be 5 types.
# 1)Rule-based expert system:  
In this type of system the set of rules can be considered as the knowledge base.
# 2)Fuzzy logic expert system:
In this type of system the solution of the problem is given by making a difference between the members of the class from the members who are not part of the class.
# 3)Frame-based expert system: 
This type of system stores and share the data using the frame structure.
# 4)Neural expert system: 
Wights of neurons are used for storing the information more formally we can say such a kind of system uses the knowledge base based on the neural network knowledge base system. 
# 5)Neuro-fuzzy expert system: 
This type of system is a combination of the neural expert system and the fuzzy logic expert system which makes the calculation using the fuzzy logic and storage of the information using the weights of neurons.
